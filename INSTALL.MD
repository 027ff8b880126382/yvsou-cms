‚úÖ How to Verify the SHA-256 Checksum
Before you install, it‚Äôs good practice to verify the file integrity:

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the .zip and the .sha256 file from the GitHub Release page
#    For example: installer-v1.0.0.zip and checksums-sha256.txt

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate the SHA-256 checksum of the downloaded file:
sha256sum installer-v1.0.0.zip

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Compare the output to the value in checksums-sha256.txt:
#    It should match exactly. For example:
#    1234567890abcdef...  installer-v1.0.0.zip

# On Mac, use:
shasum -a 256 installer-v1.0.0.zip

# On Windows (PowerShell):
Get-FileHash installer-v1.0.0.zip -Algorithm SHA256
